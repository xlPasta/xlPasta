- 🐧 Hi, I’m @xlPasta

- 👀 I’m interested in `Security` & `Application Development`
  - Of course, the application dev aspect varies (mobile, web apps, APIs)
  - Pretty big interest in automation and the intersect between automation and security
   
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ...
  - how to perform security assessments on APIs
  - how to perform security assessments on web applications
  - creating bots that perform automation with simple commands

- 💻 Coding skills I'm interested in
  - bash
  - python
  - javascript
  - go
  - rust

- 🪐 Projects I one day would like to complete
  - creation of an interactive story based game
  - at least 1 transferrable/universal security related automation tool
  - creation of a desktop app
